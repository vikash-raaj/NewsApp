# React Native News App
I have used NewsAPI.Org to fetch the news and NativeBase.io to build the UI of the app.


 News App is a personalised news aggregator that organises and highlights what’s happening in the world so that you can discover more about the stories that matter to you.


Stay up to date on your interests

• The For You tab delivers the top stories across all your favourite topics and sources in one place. You no longer need to search through various news sources across mobile and web. Examine in-depth science, entertainment, fashion, sports, cricket updates, finance or whatever else you care about.

One story. Numerous perspectives.

• With Full coverage you can be informed on how a story is reported from a variety of sources. With just a tap you’ll see recent headlines from different sources, videos, local news reports, FAQs, news analysis, social commentary and a timeline of events for stories that developed over time.

Breaking news

• The Headlines tab offers an unfiltered view of top and breaking news articles from around the world and India. Additional sections let you dig into more on tech news, business news, travel news, national and international news, health and more.

Discover new sources and topics

• The Newsstand tab makes it easy to find and follow the sources that you trust, as well as browse and discover new ones.

Access your favourite news and magazine subscriptions, together

A smart news app built for every phone, everywhere

• Articles can be downloaded over Wi-Fi to save for reading later when you are offline.
